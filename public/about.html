<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Henrik and I recently worked as a System developer at Pulsen Omsorg. 
  I'm looking for new opportunities as system developer or frontend developer with focus on .NET/React or any other programming language/frameworks.
  
I'm a team player who likes to share and help. 
I'm not afraid of learning new things as well as daring to fail in order to succeed. 
On my free time I like to play floor ball and hang out with my family & friends.
